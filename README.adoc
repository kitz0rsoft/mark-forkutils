= Hello!

Remember to have fun!

== Quickstart

To get started, try

```
make fork
```

and follow the instructions.

Note that currently it is assumed that your Github user (or organization) will
be the same as the local fork owner.

== Infrastructure requirements

You need a local infrastructure _a la_
https://github.com/org-tekeli-borisp/ansible-funtoo, referred to here as the
library.  This repository may not be very useful otherwise.

You need a Github account, and you need to set up `github-cli` to a working
state.  You should be able to create and delete a test repository in the
location where you want to put your fork.  The interesting commands are
described in `gh repo --help`.

The sources (`kit-fixups`, and the so-called "sourced kits" like
`kde-kit-sources` and friends) are not handled here.  Currently, `metatools`
does not have an easy way to mirror those, other than `kit-fixups`.  Your
local infrastructure already takes care of `kit-fixups`.
